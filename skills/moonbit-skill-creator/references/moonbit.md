# MoonBit Patterns

## Creating Scripts

When creating skills involving writing MoonBit skills, it is often helpful to
provide a minimum working example within the assets. Consult the
`assets/mbt_exec` for the minimum example that you should provide.

You must make sure that it compiles and is complete on its own, meaning that you
should not include things that depend on local resources, since the Agent might
have completely different structures. The Agent must be able to copy it to a
proper place and execute directly, as the `assets/mbt_exec` has demonstrated.
